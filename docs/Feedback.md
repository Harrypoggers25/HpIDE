# Feedback on ViperIDE

Instead of editing on my laptop, downloading, executing..... reset...  
In my prototyping cycle, I just develop directly on the board using ViperIDE. Out of a click I can soft-reset.  
I have a small script that via `mpremote` downloads my assets back to my computer for version control and snapshots.

I'm actually using it, right now, already. I happened to have a RP2040 board right here I was just writing some micropython for.
I think this is a good way to quick-start with the boards moreso than using the Thonny IDE. It handles the filesystem access perfectly.

Thank for this little IDE, I immediately love it !

This is excellent - what a superb little IDE. Blazing speed and so easy to use.
Looking forward to file upload but in the meantime I simply create a new file and paste across so no big deal.
Congrats and thank you!

I mainly use Thonny on PiPico and ESP32 and I am still just starting to Test ViperIDE. So far it seems a worthy competitor to Thonny.
It is lightweight with nothing to install and runs in the browser.
I has a very nice option to use bluetooth as your serial interface which is what attracted me to it.

Congratulations (again:-)). And thanks.
This is a very simple way to try out MP for WebAssembly.

This is awesome. New to MicroPython but Thonny was getting difficult to use.

I've just had a play with this and, just like Makecode, this should make it so much simpler for schools to use the Pico as the use of WebUSB(or WebREPL)
combined with MicroPython means the Pico looks like a serial device, not a USB device, so ignores things like BitLocker ðŸ˜ƒ
And no need to install Thonny, Mu, etc, which should keep our IT team happy  ðŸ˜‰  
...  
I've found that MicroPython on a Pico makes it appear as a serial device (whereas CP makes it appear as a USB device),
which means, just like WebUSB on the Microbit, it bypasses BitLocker ðŸ˜ƒ

For me, itâ€™s an opportunity to program from any device without worrying about installing software. Plus, instant updates mean there's no need to download anything.
